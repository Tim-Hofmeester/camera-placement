<b>Abstract</b>

Camera-trapping studies are often designed to target wide-ranging species such as large carnivores, and camera-trap placement is accordingly optimized to detect these target species. However, these studies also generate large amounts of by-catch data on non-target species. Such data are increasingly used to study ecological questions related to community structure and predator-prey interactions. However, differences in species movement ecology, habitat use, and interspecific avoidance / attraction could potentially bias inference of presence or absence of non-target species obtained from a large-carnivore centric study design. We used data from a permanent camera-trapping grid (with 38 cameras) targeted at monitoring Eurasian lynx (<i>Lynx lynx</i>) in Innlandet County, Norway, and paired additional randomly placed cameras at two spatial scales (38 cameras within the same habitat patch and 38 cameras within the same 50 km<sub>2</sub> grid cell as the lynx-targeted cameras) for three months. We used hierarchical Bayesian multi-scale occupancy models that enable the separation of large-scale occupancy, camera-scale site use and detection probability as well as single-scale occupancy models to study the effect of camera placement and number on both occupancy and detection probability of medium-sized and large mammals. We found that most species had the highest detection probability at lynx-targeted camera traps. Furthermore, two spaced-out camera traps, one targeted and one randomly placed, showed the most accurate estimates of occupancy in 50 km<sub>2</sub>-grid cells, while single cameras underestimated occupancy at this large grid cell level. We therefore recommend the use of multiple spaced-out camera traps to estimate occupancy in grid cells and to only interpret occupancy estimates from single cameras as site-use of an, as of yet undefined, area surrounding the camera trap.

<b>Data</b>

The MSocc- files contain the detection history and covariate data as used in the manuscript. Detection histories are given in an array of three dimensions: 1) grid cells (i), 2) camera sites within grid cells in the order T, H, L, (j) and 3) detection periods of 5 days (k). See manuscript for more information.

The R-script contains the description of the models and code to run the models using the jagsUI package and different MSocc- files.
